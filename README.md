For my Final Project I wanted to build a JavaScript Single Page Application that provides users with a Dashboard interface to dynamically create a simple webpage that is able to be exported as static HTML to host with a simple web server.

My goal is to use as much vanilla JavaScript (ES6) as possible, while some third-party requirements need jQuery to function correctly, my custom application code will include as little usage of non-vanilla JS as possible.

I've also used SASS, specifically SCSS, to more quickly build out my CSS stylesheets for a better developer experience and to focus more on the JS application functionality rather than the supporting technologies required for front-end web development.

## Third-Party Frameworks, Tools, and Generators
