For my Final Project I built a JavaScript Single Page Application that provides users with a Dashboard interface to dynamically create a simple webpage that is able to be previewed and exported as static HTML to host with a simple web server.

My goal is to use as much vanilla JavaScript (ES6) as possible, while some third-party requirements need jQuery to function correctly, my custom application code will include as little usage of non-vanilla JS as possible.

I've also used SASS, specifically SCSS, to more quickly build out my CSS stylesheets for a better developer experience. The SASS build process uses a VS Code extension rather than a build system like webpack.

I wanted to focus on the JS application functionality rather than the underlying base-line code that would require creating a lot of elements and styles from scratch, so I utilized the Semantic UI framework to quickly access and add basic functionality to the application. Core application functionality for webpage editing is written without the help of any frameworks.</p>

My goal is to give users an interface to reconstruct the <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/examples/homepage.html" target="_blank">Starter page template "Homepage"</a> from <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/usage/layout.html" target="_blank">Semantic UI Layouts</a> and edit it with their content and allow users to preview and export the generated HTML.

I created a demo screen capture of using the Webpage Builder App to recreate and edit the page to demonstrate the app features.
